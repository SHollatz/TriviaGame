# TriviaGame
This App is an example for practice tests which can be used to check previous or post-class understanding. 
It is intended to give students feedback about their current understanding and what they still might need to look at.
In future versions, students will get feedback about which questions they answered incorrectly and the option of additional 
informational readings.
