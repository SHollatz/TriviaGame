# TriviaGame
A quiz-app with timer that checks Chemistry students' understanding of common explosives.

## Purpose
This App is an example for practice tests which can be used to check previous or post-class understanding. 
It is intended to give students feedback about their current understanding and what they still might need to look at.
In future versions, this quiz will become a general template that helps teachers to generate feedback quizzes. 

## How to use it
Click the start button, select one choice per question and hit 'submit'. Your stats will be presented to you together with the areas you need to focus your studies on.
